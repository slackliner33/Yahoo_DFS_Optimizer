# Accuracy

* Are the results accurate?

  + The results are computed exceptionally fast and are displayed in an easy to understand and interpret manner.
  + As far as accuracy, I am not sure of the guiding assumptions that were used within the analysis.
  + Looking briefly under the hood of the `YahooDFSOptimizer::generateLineups()` function I can see that an LP is used, but I am not sure as to what other constraints were used.
  + I am not into the sports betting scene, so I am not sure how accurate or believable the results are.  But I do recognizes some of the resulting names, so I would suspect that for the coded constraints the package functions properly.

* Is it clear how the results were computed?

  + I see that an LP is used but I am not sure what constraints are being considered.
  + The `?YahooDFSOptimizer::generateLineups()` description does not provide any additional information as to how the function is working.
  + Additional information about the constraints and allowing the user to adjust the objective function would be nice additions.

# Compilation

* Did the analytic work?

  + The entire process worked very easily and quickly.

* Were error encountered when executing code according to the documentation?

  + No errors or complications with the install, accessing the Yahoo API, or in the running of the generated lineups were experienced.

# Ease of Use

* Is it clear how to use the analytic?

  + The README was very easy to understand and described what was required to execute both `YahooDFSOptimizer::scrapeDFS()` and `YahooDFSOptimizer::generateLineups()` without any issues.
 
* Are the visualization interpretable?

  + The resulting output dataframe was well constructed and provided the user a very easy to understand recommendation.
  + Additionally the dataframe also calculated a projected number of points and expected cost.
 
# Overall

The package performed very well.  Installed easily, and was very easy to use.  I would like to see a description of the LPs constraints and the ability to adjust those constraints.  However for a novice user that wants a quick recommendation this package defiantly provides that.  Overall I feel the package is Outstanding 48/50.
